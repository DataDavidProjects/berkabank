# Risk Assessment for Primary Accounts

BerkaBank asked us to build a stress test for the primary accounts. The request is to evaluate, based on transaction data, the accounts with a probability of a future Balance Distress.

Starting from this generic business task we will use the CRISPDM and come up with the following solution:

_A Continuous Training Pipeline that ranks accounts based on a conditional probability to stay for D consecutive days with a balance under a certain amount X._
